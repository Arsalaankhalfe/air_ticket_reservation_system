air_ticket_reservation_system


This project is a terminal-based administrative air ticket reservation system developed using Python and MySQL. It automates passenger registration, class-based ticket pricing, food ordering, luggage billing, and total fare calculation through a structured menu-driven interface.

The system demonstrates practical implementation of database connectivity, SQL queries, modular programming, and real-time cost computation using Python.
